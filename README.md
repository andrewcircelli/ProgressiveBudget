# Budget Tracker (PWA)

Add functionality to our existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

## Business Context

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

## Access to the Application

- You are required to submit the following:

  - the URL to the deployed application
    https://andrewcircelli-heroku-budget.herokuapp.com/

  - the URL to the Github repository
    https://github.com/andrewcircelli/ProgressiveBudget
